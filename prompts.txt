Let CS2 fully load before starting Orbit  Path: Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\bin\win64\cs2.exe  Right-click → Properties → Uncheck “Disable fullscreen optimizations”  Do not use -Vulkan in launch options    ---  Q: Orbit unloads after connecting to a game?
